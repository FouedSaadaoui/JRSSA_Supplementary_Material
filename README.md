Multiresolution Neural Networks for Electricity Market Forecasting:
Addressing Complexity with q-Wavelet Methods

This repository provides the Supplementary Material associated with the article submitted to the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (JRSS A). It documents the computational workflow underlying the Multiresolution q-Wavelet Neural Network (MQNN) framework and provides supporting resources to facilitate transparency and reproducibility.

Contents

Supplementary Material (PDF)
Describes the full workflow, including the use of MATLAB built-in functions and toolboxes, Shimotsu’s fractional differencing code, Kanzler’s GPH estimator, and the optional NARX-GUI.

Sample Dataset
A representative sample of the Australian electricity market data used in the study.
The full dataset remains publicly accessible through the permanent URL provided in the manuscript.

Purpose

The repository is intended to:

Document the computational steps used in the MQNN workflow.

Provide a sample dataset for testing and replicability.

Complement the manuscript by offering open access to supplementary resources.
